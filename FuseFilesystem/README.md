The following will run you through how to compile and fuse setup:

<!-- NOTE: below is how you represent a code block in markdown! -->
```bash
# Step 1: Compile mkmemefs

make build_mkmemefs

# Step 2: Run mkmemefs to create an memefs image

./mkmemefs <image_filename> <volume-name>

# Step 3: Create Test Dir (under /tmp). Note that this dir only needs to be created once. DO NOT PULL FILES IN THIS DIR (IT NEEDS TO REMAIN EMPTY). YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. 

make create_dir

# Step 4: Mount the Filesystem
<!-- TODO (2): Read the makefile and figure out the remaining commands.  -->
